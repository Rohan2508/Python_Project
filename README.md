Guess the Number Code Game Explanation

Import the library:random
Declare a variable:R_num in which the random number will be stored by the system
Declare a variable:G_num in which 0 is assigned initially.
Declare a variable:guess_num in which the user input guess number will be stored.
Now, by applying while loop it will iterate the process till the guess_num equal to R_num.
If the user wants to quit the game then the user should enter:quit, this will break the loop
The guess_num is converted into integer till the iterations the g_num will add 1 to itself.
When the guess_num is smaller the R_num then it will execute as small number and when the guess_num is larger then the R_num it will execute as large number.
This process will iterate until the guess_num is equal to R_num.
When the guess_num is equal to R_num then it will display as success you have guessed the right number 
It will also execute the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number.
